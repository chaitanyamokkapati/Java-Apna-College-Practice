# 1. Even or Odd Number
Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and determines whether the number is even or odd.

**Instructions:**

- If the number is divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), it is even.
- Otherwise, it is odd.

---

# 2. Largest of Three Numbers
Write a program that takes three integers as input from the user and prints the largest number.

**Instructions:**

- Use `if-else` statements to compare the three numbers and determine the largest.
- If two or more numbers are equal, display a message saying they are equal.

# 3. Grade Calculator
Write a program that takes a student's score (out of 100) and prints the corresponding grade.

**Grade Criteria:**

- 90-100: A
- 80-89: B
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- 0-59: F

**Instructions:**

- Use `if-else if` conditions to categorize the score.

# 4. Divisible by 3 and 5
Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints:

- "Divisible by 3" if the number is divisible by 3.
- "Divisible by 5" if the number is divisible by 5.
- "Divisible by both 3 and 5" if it’s divisible by both.
- "Not divisible by 3 or 5" otherwise.

**Instructions:**

- Use `if-else` statements with modulus operator `%`.

---

# 5. Leap Year Checker
Write a program that takes a year as input and checks whether it’s a leap year.

**Leap Year Rules:**

- A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100, unless they are also divisible by 400.

**Instructions:**

- Use `if-else if` to check the conditions.

---

# 6. Simple ATM System
Write a program that simulates a basic ATM system. The user can enter their PIN, and the system will check if it matches the stored PIN.

**Instructions:**

- Define a hardcoded PIN (`1234`).
- Prompt the user for the PIN and check if it matches the stored one.
- If correct, display "Access granted". If incorrect, display "Access denied".

---

# 7. Positive, Negative, or Zero
Write a program that takes an integer input and checks whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

**Instructions:**

- Use `if-else if` to categorize the number as positive, negative, or zero.

---

# 8. Simple Calculator
Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input.

**Instructions:**

- Prompt the user to choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Take two numbers as input.
- Perform the chosen operation and display the result.
- Use a `switch` statement for operations.

---

# 9. Vowel or Consonant
Write a program that takes a character as input and determines whether it’s a vowel or consonant.

**Instructions:**

- Check if the character is one of the vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`), and print the appropriate message.
- Consider both uppercase and lowercase letters.

---

# 10. Number Range Check
Write a program that checks if a number falls within a specific range (e.g., between 10 and 100 inclusive).

**Instructions:**

- Take an integer input and check if it is greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 100.
- Print a message accordingly.

---

# 11. Discount Calculation
Write a program that calculates the discount for a product based on its price.

**Discount Criteria:**

- If the price is greater than or equal to 500, apply a 20% discount.
- If the price is between 200 and 499, apply a 10% discount.
- If the price is less than 200, no discount.

**Instructions:**

- Use `if-else if` to calculate the discount and display the final price.

---

# 12. ATM Withdrawal System with Limits
Write a program for an ATM withdrawal system where the user can withdraw a specified amount of money, but the system has the following conditions:

- The user can only withdraw amounts that are multiples of 100.
- The balance must be enough for the withdrawal (assume an initial balance of 1000).

**Instructions:**

- Check if the withdrawal amount is a multiple of 100.
- Check if the balance is sufficient for the withdrawal.
- Print appropriate messages for each condition.

---

# 13. Odd or Even Digits Sum
Write a program that calculates the sum of the odd and even digits of a given number.

**Instructions:**

- Extract each digit of the number.
- Calculate the sum of even digits and the sum of odd digits separately.
- Print both sums.

---

# 14. Check Palindrome Number
Write a program that checks if a given number is a palindrome.

**Instructions:**

- A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., `121`, `12321`).
- Compare the original number with its reverse to determine if it’s a palindrome.

---

# 15. Day of the Week
Write a program that takes a number between 1 and 7 and displays the corresponding day of the week (1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 7 = Saturday).

**Instructions:**

- Use a `switch` statement to match the number to the day of the week.
