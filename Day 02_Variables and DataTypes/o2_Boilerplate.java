// Boilerplate Code
// This is a basic structure of a Java program. The code here is often written 
// even if we donâ€™t know yet what the main logic will be. It's like a template to start with.
public class o2_Boilerplate { // The program is named "o2_Boilerplate". This is the name of the class.
// public : The class is publicly accessible, meaning it can be used by other classes in the application.
// class : This keyword is used to define a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects or organizing code.

    public static void main(String[] args) { // This is the main method where the program starts running.
    // public : The main method must be public so that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can call it from outside.
    // static : This allows the main method to be run without creating an instance of the class.
    // void : This indicates that the main method does not return any value.
    // main() : The main method is the entry point of any Java application.
    // String : This specifies that the argument is an array of Strings.
    // args[] : This is the parameter that can hold command-line arguments passed to the program.
