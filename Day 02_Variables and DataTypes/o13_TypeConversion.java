/*
In Java, type conversion refers to the process of converting one data type to another. 
Java provides two main types of type conversions: 
    1. Implicit Type Conversion (Widening) and 
        Widening: byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double
    2. Explicit Type Conversion (Narrowing).
        Narrowing: double -> float -> long -> int -> short -> byte
