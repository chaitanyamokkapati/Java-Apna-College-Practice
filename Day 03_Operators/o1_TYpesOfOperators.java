/*
 In Java, operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations 
 on variables and values. Java has a variety of operators that can be classified 
 into several categories:

1. Arithmetic Operators
   Used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

+ : Addition
- : Subtraction
* : Multiplication
/ : Division
% : Modulus (remainder of division)

2. Relational (Comparison) Operators
   Used to compare two values.

== : Equal to
!= : Not equal to
> : Greater than
< : Less than
>= : Greater than or equal to
<= : Less than or equal to

3. Logical Operators
   Used to combine multiple boolean expressions.

&& : Logical AND
|| : Logical OR
! : Logical NOT

4. Assignment Operators
   Used to assign values to variables.

= : Simple assignment
+= : Addition assignment
-= : Subtraction assignment
*= : Multiplication assignment
/= : Division assignment
%= : Modulus assignment

5. Unary Operators
   Used to perform operations on a single operand.

+ : Unary plus (indicates a positive value)
- : Unary minus (negates the value)
++ : Increment (increases value by 1)
-- : Decrement (decreases value by 1)
! : Logical NOT (inverts boolean value)

6. Bitwise Operators
   Used to perform bit-level operations on integer types.

& : Bitwise AND
| : Bitwise OR
^ : Bitwise XOR
~ : Bitwise NOT
<< : Left shift
>> : Right shift
>>> : Unsigned right shift

7. Ternary Operator
   A shorthand for an if-else statement.

condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false

8. Instanceof Operator
   Used to check whether an object is an instance of a specific class or interface.

instanceof : Checks the type of an object

9. Type Cast Operator
   Used to convert a variable from one data type to another.

(type) : Type casting
