The Binomial Coefficient, denoted as \( \binom{n}{r} \) or \( nCr \), is given by the following formula:

$$
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$

Where:

- \( n! \) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \),
- \( r! \) (r factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \( r \),
- \( (n-r)! \) is the factorial of \( (n-r) \).

### Example

To calculate \( \binom{5}{2} \), you would compute:

$$
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{120}{2 \times 6} = 10
$$

### Special Cases

1. \( \binom{n}{0} = 1 \) for any \( n \geq 0 \),
2. \( \binom{n}{n} = 1 \) for any \( n \geq 0 \),
3. \( \binom{n}{1} = n \),
4. \( \binom{n}{n-1} = n \).
